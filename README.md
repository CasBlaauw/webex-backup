# webex-backup
A tool to create backups of your webex spaces.

Built on the great work by Dirk-Jan Uittenbogaard for his [Webex Teams Space Archiver](https://github.com/DJF3/Webex-Message-space-archiver).
Instead of a single space, this script backs up all spaces in one go, with the option to specifically back up one-to-one conversations or group conversations.
It is available as [a python script](webex-archive.py) and as [executables for Mac and Windows](releases/latest), built with [pyinstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/).
A guide for each of the three options can be found [here](https://casblaauw.github.io/backup.html). 

As this code is based on Webex Teams Space Archiver, it has inherited the [Cisco Sample Code License](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/licenses).
